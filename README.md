## A Modpack that turns minecraft java into minecraft bedrock

Theres about 16 mods in here that turn minecraft java into a minecraft bedrock lookalike. i made the title screen even look like minecraft bedrocks.

## Fetures:
- Mineraft bedrock GUI's
- A Minecraft Bedrock like world creation menu
- Bedrock like main menu
- Fade In Chunks like Bedrock
- And much more fetures!

You can edit a lot of stuff in the configs if you want to.
